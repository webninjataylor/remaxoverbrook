        <h1>Why use RE/MAX?</h1>
        <p>When you choose a RE/MAX Sales Associate to sell your home or help  you purchase a new home, you'll experience a whole new level of service.</p>
        <p>First,  RE/MAX Associates are The Hometown Experts With a World of Experience®.  Across the globe, they make their living in the same communities in  which they live. They're the people next door, or just down the block.</p>
        <p>Consummate  professionals, RE/MAX Associates on average lead agents of competing  brands in advanced real estate education and production. That's why  they're known as &quot;The Real Estate Leaders®&quot; and why no one in the world  sells more real estate than RE/MAX.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong><br />
          The  proof of quality service is in repeat customers and in customers who  refer RE/MAX Associates to their friends. RE/MAX Sales Associates  average 70 percent of their business from repeats and referrals, while  other agents average about 30 percent from those sources.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Education</strong><br />
          RE/MAX  Associates lead agents of competing brands in professional  designations, which denote specialized training and education. They  dominate the Accredited Buyer Representative (ABR), Certified  Relocation Professional (CRP), Certified Residential Specialist (CRS)  and Leadership Training Graduate (LTG) ranks.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Miracle Home®</strong><br />
          Why  list your home with a RE/MAX Associate? Your home may be designated as  a Miracle Home®. If it is, your RE/MAX Sales Associate will make a  contribution on behalf of the listing and/or sale to the local hospital  affiliated with the <a href="http://www.childrensmiraclenetwork.org/" target="_blank">Children's Miracle Network</a>. The funds raised in your community remain in the area to benefit local children.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>For All You're Worth®</strong><br />
          On  average, RE/MAX associates sell more real estate than other agents.  They are better qualified to set the right price for the homes they  list, are better equipped to market those homes, and are likely to find  a buyer in a shorter period of time. That experience and education also  means they are better qualified to find the right home for any buyer.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Competitive Advantage</strong><br />
          The  real estate network that has the most competitive advantages to offer  both home buyers and sellers will be an industry leader, and RE/MAX is  that network. No one in the world sells more real estate than RE/MAX.<br />
          <br />
          When  you look for the highest quality real estate service, look to a RE/MAX  Associate. RE/MAX Associates are &quot;The Real Estate Leaders®&quot;.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Advertising</strong><br />
          On  average, a RE/MAX Associate spends about $10,000 each year on personal  promotion and on individual and group advertising. Personal advertising  plus national television advertising and Internet exposure generates  the highest number of prospects in the industry.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Network Size</strong><br />
          The  revolutionary RE/MAX Concept of enabling real estate professionals to  maximize their business potential has evolved into an organization of  more than 110,000 Sales Associates in more than 5,600 offices.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The RE/MAX Balloon Logo</strong><br />
          The  red, white and blue RE/MAX Balloon, with its &quot;Above the Crowd®&quot; slogan,  is one of the most recognizable business logos in the world. With more  than 90 RE/MAX Hot Air Balloons around the globe, RE/MAX has the  world's largest balloon fleet.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Sign That Brings You Home®</strong><br />
          The  famous red-over-white-over-blue RE/MAX yard sign and your RE/MAX agent  lead you to properties in areas in which you'll want to live and work.  If you want to sell your property, the RE/MAX yard sign attracts  buyers. Nobody sells more real estate than RE/MAX.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>An Industry Leader</strong><br />
          RE/MAX  was the first real estate network to be involved in more than 1 million  transaction sides in a single year. Each transaction or sale consists  of two sides, the listing side and the selling side.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Global Expansion</strong><br />
          With  offices in more than 50 countries worldwide, RE/MAX is one of the  fastest-growing real estate franchise networks on the planet.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Main Street. Not Wall Street.®</strong><br />
          Being  locally owned and operated, RE/MAX offices are staffed with  professionals who live in the area they work in. Thus, committed to  their local community, they have a deep personal interest in the  customers they serve.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Home of the Best Agents®</strong><br />
          In  a business environment of mergers and acquisitions, RE/MAX is the only  major real estate network still owned and directed by its founders. The  excellence of RE/MAX Broker/Owners and Sales Associates has led to an  ever-increasing number of accolades from the business community at  large. &quot;Worth&quot; magazine honored RE/MAX with its prestigious &quot;Readers'  Choice&quot; award in both 1999 and 2000, naming RE/MAX the No. 1 real  estate brokerage. In January 2005, &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine ranked  RE/MAX among the top 10 franchises in its 26th Annual Franchise 500  survey. It also named RE/MAX:&quot;Best of the Best&quot; for real estate  services; the highest-ranking real estate franchise in &quot;Low Cost  Franchises&quot;; and No. 7 overall in &quot;America's Top Global Franchises.&quot;<br />
